//! A set of messages that can be recorded in PBC, and sent to colony chains.
//!
//! Note that it's not mandatory to use the following types directly in
//! `trait ColonyChain` -> Contract communication, but the contract has to convert the message
//! into `MessageDeliveryRecord` anyway, so that it can request a verification of it to the light client.
//! (because the light client needs the very exact string format that PBC has actually recorded)
//!
//! Messages will be JSON-encoded.
